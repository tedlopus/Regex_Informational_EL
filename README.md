# Regex_Informational_EL
A deeper dive into regular expressions and how they work. This is an informational guide for JavaScript regular expressions and what exactly "regular expression" means. Please enjoy this read.

## Summary
A regular expression in JavaScript are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. Regular expressions can also be objects which can be constructed one of two ways. The first way to create regular expressions is by usind literal notation. The literal notation parameters are enclosed within slashes. The other way to create regular expressions is by using a constuctor. The constructor's function parameters are enclosed with quotations. As we continue to disect regex, we will be using /word/ as our base example. Each section of this will use this example to clearly show the topic being discussed.
